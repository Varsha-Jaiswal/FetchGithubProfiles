# FetchGithubProfiles


This project is to fetch the GitHub Profiles based on user's choice.
  1) It can fetch all the users from "https://api.github.com/users" and show them on the webpage.
  2) It can search of any user/login name provided by the user, and can show the profile of that user(if available).
  
This repo is having the implementation of same code using:
  1) Ajax - develop-ajax branch
  2) FetchAPI - develop-fetchAPI branch
 
It shows that how easily we can perform the operations using FetchAPI, as compared to Ajax and shows the implementation on FetchAPI along with Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript.
